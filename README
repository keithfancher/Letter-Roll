A simple script that helps you cheat at "Letter Roll," a Boggle-esque dice
game. More info about the game here:

http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/letter-roll/


USAGE
-----
Just call the script with the letters you've rolled and the matching words will
be printed to standard output:

    $ ./letterroll.py ajbr
    abjuration
    abjurations
    abjure
    abjured
    abjures
    abjuring
    [etc.]

Then just write them down as quickly as your wrists can manage, taking care not
to reveal your underhandedness to your poor, unsuspecting opponents.
