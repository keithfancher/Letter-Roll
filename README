A simple script that helps you cheat at "Letter Roll," a Boggle-esque dice
game. More info about the game here:

http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/letter-roll/


USAGE
-----
Call the script with the filename of a dictionary (one is included if you need
it) and the letters you've rolled. The matching words will be printed to
standard output:

    $ ./letterroll.py american-english abjd
    abjured
    adjustable
    blackjacked
    jabbed
    jabbered
    jawboned
    subjugated

Then just write them down as quickly as your wrists can manage, taking care not
to reveal your underhandedness to your poor, unsuspecting opponents.
