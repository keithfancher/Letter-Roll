A simple script that helps you cheat at "Letter Roll," a Boggle-esque dice
game. More info about the game here:

http://www.marblesthebrainstore.com/letter-roll/


USAGE
-----
Call the script with the filename of a dictionary (one is included if you need
it) and the letters you've rolled. The matching words will be printed to
standard output:

    $ ./letterroll.py american-english abjd
    abjured
    adjustable
    blackjacked
    jabbed
    jabbered
    jawboned
    subjugated

Then just write them down as quickly as your wrists can manage, taking care not
to reveal your underhandedness to your poor, unsuspecting opponents.


WEB INTERFACE
-------------
I also threw together a basic web interface, so you can more easily cheat with
your phone (or other machines on your network, or whatever). First, make sure
you've got Flask installed:

    $ sudo pip install flask

Then start the server:

    $ ./web_letterroll.py

Now you can navigate to 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser and you should be good
to go!

Note: It's fine to run this on a firewalled machine on your local network, but
you probably shouldn't run it on any computer that's exposed to the Big Bad Old
Internet!  (Especially while it's in debug mode...)
